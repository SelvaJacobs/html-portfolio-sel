<h3>My Spouse..</h3>
<p>
  She is Nisha.. my love and soul... She is a Malayalee from small village named Punalur, near Kollam. She done her schooling and graduation there. Moved to Delhi for job and stayed with her brother family. 
  BTW, she has 3 brothers and 1 sister, that makes her the last princess of her family.
  She is cool and short tempered.. But matured enough to take care of me and my family. More about her in further blogs.
